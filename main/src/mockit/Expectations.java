/**
 * Base class whose subclasses are defined in test code, and whose instances define a set of <em>expected</em> and/or
 * <em>allowed</em> method/constructor invocations on the mocked types declared through one or more <em>mock fields</em>
 * and/or <em>mock parameters</em>.
 * A (local) mock field is any field declared in a subclass which is either non-private or annotated with
 * {@link Mocked}.
 * <p/>
 * Typically, this class is used by extending it with <em>anonymous inner classes</em> (named as <em>expectation
 * blocks</em>) inside test methods, which record expectations on mocked types by calling instance methods on mock
 * fields/parameters, static methods on mocked classes, and/or constructors of mocked classes.
 * Arguments passed in such calls are later matched to the actual arguments passed from the code under test.
 * <p/>
 * Any mock fields declared within an expectation block will only be accessible for invocations inside this particular
 * block.
 * An alternative is to declare mock fields of the <em>test class</em> itself, so that all of its test methods can share
 * the same mock fields. Such fields need to be annotated as {@code @Mocked}, though.
 * <p/>
 * There are several API fields and methods which the expectation block can use for recording desired return values and
 * exceptions/errors to be thrown (see {@link #result}), and for specifying argument matching constraints such as
 * {@link #withEqual(Object)}.
 * <p/>
 * Individual expectations are defined during the <em>record phase</em>, and later exercised during the
 * <em>replay phase</em> of the test.
 * At the end of the test, the test runner will automatically assert that all <em>expected</em> invocations actually
 * occurred during the replay phase. (An expectation block may also record expectations that are merely
 * <em>allowed</em> to occur, and as such are not implicitly verified at the end of the test.)
 * <p/>
 * Additional features and details:
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * A <strong>mock field</strong> can be of any non-primitive type, including interfaces, abstract classes, and concrete
 * classes (even {@code final} classes).
 * An instance will be automatically created when the subclass gets instantiated, unless the field is {@code final}
 * (in which case, the test code itself will have the responsibility of obtaining an appropriate instance).
 * This mocked instance can then be used inside the expectation block for the recording of expectations on instance
 * methods; <strong>static methods</strong> and <strong>constructors</strong> belonging to the mocked class or its
 * super-classes are also mocked, and can also have expectations recorded on them.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * Unless specified otherwise, all expectations defined inside an {@code Expectations} immediate subclass will be
 * <em>strict</em>, meaning that the recorded invocations are <em>expected</em> to occur in the same order during the
 * replay phase, and that non-recorded invocations are <em>not allowed</em>.
 * This default behavior can be overridden for individual expectations through the {@link #notStrict()} method, and for
 * whole mocked types through the {@link NonStrict} annotation.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * There is a set of API methods that allow the {@linkplain #newInstance(String, Class[], Object...) instantiation of
 * non-accessible (to the test) classes}, the {@linkplain #invoke(Object, String, Object...) invocation of
 * non-accessible methods}, and the {@linkplain #setField(Object, String, Object) setting of non-accessible fields}.
 * Most tests shouldn't need these facilities, though.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * A set of special API fields provides the ability to specify how many {@linkplain #times times} a recorded invocation
 * is expected <em>and</em> allowed to occur during replay, the {@linkplain #minTimes minimum number of times} it's
 * expected, or the {@linkplain #maxTimes maximum number of times} it will be allowed to occur.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * By default, the exact instance on which instance method invocations occur during the replay phase is <em>not</em>
 * verified to be the same as the instance used when recording the corresponding expectation.
 * If such verification is needed, the {@link #onInstance(Object)} method should be used.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * There are additional constructors which provide other features:
 * {@linkplain #Expectations(Object...) dynamic partial mocking}, and
 * {@linkplain #Expectations(int, Object...) iterated invocations}.
 * </li>
 * </ul>
