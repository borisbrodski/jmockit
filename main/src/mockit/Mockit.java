/**
 * Provides static methods for the mocking and stubbing of arbitrary classes from production code,
 * according to specified <em>mock classes</em> defined in test code.
 * Such methods are intended to be called from test code only.
 * <p/>
 * Once mocked, a "real" method defined in a production class will behave (during test execution) as
 * if its implementation was replaced by a call to the corresponding <em>mock method</em> in the
 * mock class.
 * Whatever value this mock method returns will be the value returned by the call to the mocked
 * method.
 * The mock method can also throw an exception or error, which will then be propagated to the caller
 * of the mocked "real" method.
 * Therefore, while mocked the original code in the real method is never executed (actually, there's
 * still a way to execute the real implementation, although not normally used for testing purposes).
 * The same basic rules apply to constructors, which can be mocked by corresponding <em>mock
 * constructors</em> or by special mock methods.
 * <p/>
 * The methods in this class can be divided in the following groups:
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <strong>Stubbing API</strong>: {@link #stubOut(Class...)},
 * {@link #stubOutClass(Class, String...)}, and {@link #stubOutClass(Class, boolean, String...)}.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <strong>Annotations API</strong> for state-based mocking: {@link MockUp},
 * {@link #setUpMocks(Object...)}, {@link #setUpMock(Class, Class)} and its several overloads,
 * {@link #setUpStartupMocks(Object...)}, {@link #setUpMocksAndStubs(Class...)}, and
 * {@link #tearDownMocks(Class...)} / {@link #tearDownMocks()}.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <strong>Core API</strong> for state-based mocking on JDK 1.4, now obsolete: 
 * {@linkplain #redefineMethods(Class, Class)} and its several overloads, and
 * {@link #restoreAllOriginalDefinitions()} / {@link #restoreOriginalDefinition(Class...)}.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <strong>Proxy-based utilities</strong>:
 * {@link #newEmptyProxy(ClassLoader, Class)} and its overloads.
 * These are merely convenience methods that create empty implementation classes for one or more
 * interfaces, where all implemented methods do nothing beyond returning a default value according
 * to the return type of each interface method.
 * The created classes can be redefined/mocked through the Core or Annotations API, and its
 * instances passed to code under test.
 * </li>
 * </ul>

    * Redefines methods and/or constructors in the real class with the corresponding methods or
    * constructors in a mock class (in all documentation, wherever we mention a mock/real method,
    * keep in mind that it also applies to constructors).
    * <p/>
    * For each call made during test execution to a mocked real method, the corresponding mock
    * method is called instead. For an instance mock method, the mock class instance on which the
    * call is made is created with the default constructor for the mock class, <strong>every
    * time</strong> the mocked real method is called. If you want to reuse mock instances for all
    * such calls you should pass an instance of the mock class instead of its <code>Class</code>
    * object.
    * <p/>
    * For a <strong>mock method</strong> to be considered as <strong>corresponding</strong> to a
    * given <strong>real method</strong>, it must have the same name, the exact same parameter types
    * in the same order, and also the exact same return type. The throws clauses may differ in any
    * way. Note also that the mock method can be static or not, independently of the real method
    * being static or not.
    * <p/>
    * A constructor in the real class can be mocked by a corresponding <strong>mock
    * constructor</strong> in the mock class, declared with the same signature.
    * However, since a constructor can only be called on a freshly created instance, it is generally
    * recommended to declare a mock method of name <code>$init</code> instead (which can also be
    * <code>static</code>). This method should have <code>void</code> return type and must have the
    * same declared parameters as the mocked constructor. It will be called for each new instance of
    * the real class that is created through a call to that constructor, with whatever arguments are
    * passed to it.
    * <p/>
    * <strong>Class initializers</strong> of the real class (one or more <code>static</code>
    * initialization blocks plus all assignments to <code>static</code> fields) can be mocked by
    * providing a mock method named <code>$clinit</code> in the mock class.
    * This method should return <code>void</code> and have no declared parameters.
    * It will called at most once, at the time the real class is initialized by the JVM (and since
    * all static initializers for that class are mocked, the initialization will have no effect).
    * <p/>
    * In a mock class, each method intended as a mock for some real method must be public.
    * Non-public methods in the mock class are allowed, but are not considered to be mocks.
    * <p/>
    * The mock class must not be private, being either public or defined in the same package as the
    * real class, so that the modified methods in the real class can make valid calls.
    * Note that anonymous inner class instances are accepted as mocks.
    * <p/>
    * Any constructor in the real class can be redefined by a corresponding public mock constructor,
    * except the default no-args constructor. This restriction is only to avoid the inconvenience of
    * having to explicitly define a non-public no-args constructor in the mock class, in the most
    * common case where a mock for the default constructor is not wanted. If you want to mock the
    * default constructor, then use the overload that takes a boolean parameter to indicate that.
    * <p/>
    * Mock methods and even constructors can gain access to the instance of the real class on which
    * the corresponding real method or constructor was called. This requires that the mock class
    * defines an instance field with name <strong>"it"</strong> of the same type as the real class,
    * and accessible from that real class (in general, this means the field will have to be
    * <code>public</code>). Such a field will always be set to the appropriate real class instance,
    * whenever a mock method is called. Note that through this field the mock class will be able to
    * call any accessible instance method on the real class, including the real method corresponding
    * to the current mock method. In this case, however, such calls are not allowed because they
    * lead to infinite recursion, with the mock calling itself indirectly through the redefined real
    * method. If you really need to call the real method from its mock method, then you will have to
    * use the <em>JMockit Annotations</em> API, such as {@link #setUpMocks(Object...)}, using the
    * {@link Mock} annotation with <code>reentrant = true</code>.
    *
    * @param realClass the class from production code to be mocked, which is used by code under test
    * @param mockClass the class containing the mock methods that will replace methods of same
    *                  signature in the real class
    *
