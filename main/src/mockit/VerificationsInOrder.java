    * Accounts for a sequence of non-strict invocations executed in the replay phase that are not explicitly verified
    * in this block.
    * Note that even the invocations that are implicitly verified (due to a minimum invocation count specified in the
    * <em>record</em> phase) will be accounted for (if any), since their replay order cannot be verified otherwise.
    * (Obviously, this doesn't apply to <em>strict</em> invocations, whose replay order is always verified implicitly.)
    * <p/>
    * Which invocations belong or not in this sequence depends on the relative position of the call to this method with
    * respect to the explicitly verified invocations in the same block.
    * <p/>
    * This can be used to verify that one or more consecutive invocations occurred <em>before</em> others, and
    * conversely to verify that one or more consecutive invocations occurred <em>after</em> others.
    * The call to this method marks the position where the unverified invocations are expected to have occurred,
    * relative to the explicitly verified ones.
    * <p/>
    * Each sequence of explicit verifications in the block will correspond to a <em>consecutive</em> sequence of
    * invocations in the replay phase of the test.
    * So, if this method is called more than once from the same verification block, then an arbitrary sequence of
    * consecutive invocations between said calls will be verified.
    * Notice that when this method is not used, the invocations in the replay phase need <em>not</em> be consecutive,
    * but only have the same relative order as the verification calls.
    * <p/>
    * Finally, notice that you can combine an ordered block that verifies the position of some calls relative to others,
    * with a previous unordered block which verifies some or all of those other invocations.
