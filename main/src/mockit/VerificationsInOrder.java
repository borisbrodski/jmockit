   /**
    * Accounts for a sequence of non-strict invocations executed in the replay phase that are not
    * explicitly verified in this block.
    * Note that even the invocations that are implicitly verified (due to a minimum invocation count
    * specified in the <em>record</em> phase) will be accounted for (if any), since their replay
    * order cannot be verified otherwise. (Obviously, this doesn't apply to <em>strict</em>
    * invocations, whose replay order is always verified implicitly.)
    * <p/>
    * Which invocations belong or not in this sequence depends on the relative position of the call
    * to this method with respect to the explicitly verified invocations in the same block.
    * <p/>
    * This can be used to verify that one or more consecutive invocations occurred <em>before</em>
    * others, and conversely to verify that one or more consecutive invocations occurred
    * <em>after</em> others.
    * The call to this method marks the position where the unverified invocations are expected to
    * have occurred, relative to the explicitly verified ones.
    * <p/>
    * Each sequence of explicit verifications in the block will correspond to a <em>consecutive</em>
    * sequence of invocations in the replay phase of the test.
    * So, if this method is called more than once from the same verifications block, an arbitrary
    * sequence of consecutive invocations, between two calls to this method, can be verified.
    * Notice that when this method is not used, the invocations in the replay phase need
    * <em>not</em> be consecutive, but only have the same relative order as the verification calls.
    * <p/>
    * Finally, notice that you can combine an ordered block that verifies the position of some calls
    * relative to others, with an unordered block which verifies some or all of those other
    * invocations.
    * <p/>
