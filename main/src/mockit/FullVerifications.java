 * Any invocation in the replay phase not covered by one of these verifications will cause an
 * assertion error to be thrown.

 * Note that the behavior provided by this class is basically the same obtained with
 * {@linkplain Expectations strict expectations} (where no unexpected invocations are allowed),
 * except for the ordering and the number of occurrences of invocations, which are both still
 * "non-strict".
