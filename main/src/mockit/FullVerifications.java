 * Same as {@link Verifications}, but checking that all invocations in the replay phase are
 * explicitly verified in this verification block.
 * This way, the verification block represents a full set of verifications for the mocked types
 * used in the test.
 * <p/>
 * Any invocation in the replay phase not covered by one of these verifications will cause an
 * assertion error to be thrown.
 * <p/>
 * Note that the behavior provided by this class is basically the same obtained with
 * {@linkplain Expectations strict expectations} (where no unexpected invocations are allowed),
 * except for the ordering and the number of occurrences of invocations, which are both still
 * "non-strict".
