/**
 * Base class whose subclasses are defined in test code, and whose instances define a set of
 * invocations on mocks to be verified against the actual invocations executed during the replay
 * phase of the test.
 * The order of the invocations is not relevant, and any subset of the potential invocations in the
 * replay phase can be verified (ie, not all of them need to be verified on each use of this class).
 * <p/>
 * Since each subclass will typically take the form of an anonymous class with no methods but only
 * an instance initialization block, we name such constructs <em>verification blocks</em>.
 * In the particular case of using this class directly, we have an <em>unordered</em> verification
 * block.
 * <p/>
 * Such blocks can appear alone in a test or in conjunction with
 * {@linkplain Expectations strict expectation blocks} which record at least one non-strict
 * expectation, and/or {@linkplain NonStrictExpectations non-strict expectation blocks}.
 * (Strict expectations are unconditionally and automatically verified as invocations occur in the
 * replay phase, and at the end of the test to account for any missing invocations.)
 * <p/>
 * Note that while an expectation block can appear only <em>before</em> the replay phase of the
 * test, a verification block can appear only <em>after</em> that phase.
 * <p/>
 * For an invocation inside a verification block to succeed (ie, pass verification), a
 * corresponding invocation must have occurred during the replay phase of the test, at least once.
 * Such an invocation may or may not have been previously recorded in an expectation block.
 * <p/>
 * The mocked types used inside the verification block can be all the ones that are in scope: mock
 * fields of the test class, and mock parameters of the test method. In addition, local mock fields
 * declared inside expectation blocks can be <em>imported</em> into the verification block by
 * declaring a field of the desired mocked type inside this block (not necessarily with the same
 * name as the imported mock field, although that is recommended for clarity).
 * <p/>
 * Just like it is valid to have multiple expectation blocks in a test, it is also valid to have
 * multiple (non-nested) verification blocks. The relative order of the blocks is not relevant.
 * Such blocks can be of different types. (Typically, when using multiple verification blocks there
 * will be a mix of ordered and unordered ones.)
