/**
 * For tests using {@link mockit.Expectations}, indicates a <em>non-strict</em> mocked type for an
 * instance field or test method parameter.
 * <p/>
 * While in the replay phase, invocations on the non-strict mocked type can be made in any number
 * and in any order.
 * For each of these invocations, the result (return value or thrown error/exception) will be either
 * a "no-op" (doing nothing for constructors and {@code void} methods, or returning the default
 * value appropriate to the return type) or whatever was specified through a matching invocation
 * executed in the record phase (matching on the parameter values, optionally using Hamcrest
 * matchers).
 * Note that multiple invocations to the same method or constructor can be recorded, provided
 * different arguments are used.
 * <p/>
 * Each recorded non-strict invocation still specifies an expectation, but without any invocation
 * count constraint to be satisfied. Therefore, a corresponding invocation in the replay phase will
 * not be required for the test to pass.
 * By default, any number of such corresponding invocations can occur in the replay phase for the
 * recorded invocation, in any order.
 * If a lower/upper limit or an exact number of invocations is expected, then the appropriate
 * constraint method should be used after recording the invocation.
 * <p/>
 * Invocations to non-strict mocks or mocked types that should occur in the replay phase can be
 * explicitly verified at the end of the test using a {@linkplain mockit.Verifications verification
 * block}.
