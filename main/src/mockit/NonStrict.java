/**
 * For tests using {@link mockit.Expectations}, indicates a <em>non-strict</em> mocked type for an
 * instance field or test method parameter.
 * <p/>
 * While in the replay phase, invocations on the non-strict mocked type can be made in any number
 * and in any order.
 * For each of these invocations, the result (return value or thrown error/exception) will be either
 * a "no-op" (doing nothing for constructors and {@code void} methods, or returning the default
 * value appropriate to the return type) or whatever was specified through a matching invocation
 * executed in the record phase (matching on the parameter values, optionally using Hamcrest
 * matchers).
 * Note that multiple invocations to the same method or constructor can be recorded, provided
 * different arguments are used.
 * <p/>
 * Each recorded invocation still specifies an expectation, so a corresponding invocation in the
 * replay phase will be required for the test to pass.
 * By default, more than one such corresponding invocations can occur for each recorded invocation
 * (in any order).
 * If an upper limit or exact number of invocations is desired, then the appropriate constraint
 * method should be used in the record phase.
 * <p/>
 * Invocations that are <strong>not</strong> recorded but should occur in the replay phase may be
 * explicitly verified at the end of the test using a {@linkplain mockit.Verifications
 * verification block}.
