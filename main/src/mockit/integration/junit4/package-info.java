/**
 * Provides integration with <em>JUnit 4.x</em> test runners.
 * <p/>
 * Contains the "startup mock" implementation for integration with the JUnit 4.5+ test runner.
 * (JUnit 4.4 had a different test runner which was deprecated, and is no longer supported.)
 * <p/>
 * The integration adds the following benefits to test code:
 * <ol>
 * <li>
 * Unexpected invocations specified through the Annotations or the Expectations API are
 * automatically verified just before the execution of a test ends (that is, after the test itself
 * executed, but before any {@code @After} methods are executed).
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * Any mock classes applied with the Annotations API from inside a test method will be discarded
 * before the execution of the test method ends, so it is not necessary to call
 * {@link mockit.Mockit#tearDownMocks()} at the end of the test, be it from inside the test method
 * itself or from an {@code @After} method.
 * The same is <em>not</em> true for mocks applied in a {@code @Before} method, however: you
 * <em>will</em> need to explicitly tear down those mock classes in an {@code @After} method, so
 * that the mocked real classes are properly restored to their original definitions.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * Any {@linkplain mockit.MockClass mock class} set up for the whole test class (either through
 * a call to {@link mockit.Mockit#setUpMocks} from inside a {@code @BeforeClass} method, or by
 * annotating the test class with {@link mockit.UsingMocksAndStubs}) will only apply to the test
 * methods in this same test class.
 * That is, you should not explicitly tell JMockit to restore the mocked classes in an
 * {@code @AfterClass} method.
 * </li>
 * </ol>
