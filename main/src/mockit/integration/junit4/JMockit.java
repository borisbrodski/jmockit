/**
 * A test runner for <em>JUnit 4.5+</em>, with special modifications to integrate with JMockit.
 * Normally, though, it shouldn't be necessary to use this class. Instead, simply make sure that
 * {@code jmockit.jar} precedes {@code junit-4.n.jar} in the classpath, when running on JDK 1.6+
 * (if running on JDK 1.5, then "-javaagent:jmockit.jar" will be mandatory and this class would have
 * no effect since JMockit would already be initialized).
 * <p/>
 * If you happen to already have a {@code @RunWith} annotation in your JUnit test classes, you
 * can still activate integration by simply making sure that JMockit is initialized before any test
 * is executed. For example, the following static block in the test class or in a base test class
 * will get the job done:
 * <pre>
   static
   {
      Mockit.setUpMocks();
   }
 * </pre>
 * <a href="http://jmockit.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/www/tutorial/RunningTests.html">Tutorial</a>
 *
 * @see JMockitTest
 * @deprecated Use the {@code -javaagent:jmockit.jar} JVM parameter, or make sure that
 * {@code junit.jar} (4.5+) appears before {@code jmockit.jar} in the classpath if running under
 * JDK 1.6.
