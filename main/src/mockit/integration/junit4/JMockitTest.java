/**
 * A convenience base class for tests which use the JMockit toolkit with <em>JUnit 4.5+</em>.
 * <p/>
 * Besides being annotated with <code>@RunWith(JMockit.class)</code>, the use of this base class for
 * your test classes has the advantage of inheriting {@link org.junit.Assert}, which eliminates the
 * need to statically import its methods.
 * <p/>
 * It is recommended to use either <code>@RunWith(JMockit.class)</code> or
 * <code>extends JMockitTest</code> for all JUnit 4 test classes, so that JMockit gets properly
 * initialized before any tests are executed. Otherwise, JMockit will have to be initialized through
 * a call to <code>Mockit.setUpMocks();</code> in a static initialization block, or through the use
 * of "-javaagent:jmockit.jar" as a JVM command line argument.
 * <p/>
 * If JMockit is not explicitly initialized before the first test executes, it will still get
 * initialized on the first call to a method in the API. However, this will probably cause the first
 * test, and possibly others, to fail.
