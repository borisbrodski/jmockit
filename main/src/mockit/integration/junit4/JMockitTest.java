/**
 * A convenience base class for tests which use the JMockit toolkit with <em>JUnit 4.5+</em>.
 * Normally, though, it shouldn't be necessary to use this class. Instead, simply make sure that
 * {@code jmockit.jar} precedes {@code junit-4.n.jar} in the classpath, when running on JDK 1.6+
 * (if running on JDK 1.5, then "-javaagent:jmockit.jar" will be mandatory and this class would have
 * no effect since JMockit would already be initialized).
 * <p/>
 * Besides being annotated with {@code @RunWith(JMockit.class)}, the use of this base class for
 * your test classes has the advantage of inheriting {@link org.junit.Assert}, which eliminates the
 * need to statically import its methods.
 * <p/>
 * If JMockit is not explicitly initialized before the first test executes, it will still get
 * initialized on the first call to a method in the API. However, this will probably cause the first
 * test, and possibly others, to fail.
 * <p/>
