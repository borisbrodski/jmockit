/**
 * Provides integration with <em>TestNG</em> test runners, for versions 5.9+.
 * Contains the {@link mockit.integration.testng.Initializer} test listener class that can be specified to TestNG at
 * startup, as well as the "startup mock" implementation for integration with the TestNG test runner.
 * <p/>
 * This integration provides the same benefits to test code as the one for JUnit 4:
 * <ol>
 * <li>
 * Unexpected invocations specified through the Annotations or the Expectations API are automatically verified just
 * before the execution of a test ends (specifically, immediately after the execution of the test method).
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * Any mock classes applied with the Annotations API from inside a test method will be discarded right after the
 * execution of the test method, so it is not necessary to explicitly call {@link mockit.Mockit#tearDownMocks()},
 * be it from inside the test method itself or from an {@code @AfterMethod}/{@code @After} method.
 * The same is <em>not</em> true for mock classes applied in a {@code @BeforeMethod}/{@code @Before} method, however:
 * you <em>will</em> need to explicitly tear down those mock classes in an {@code @AfterMethod}/{@code @After} method,
 * so that the mocked real classes are properly restored to their original definitions.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * Any {@linkplain mockit.MockClass mock class} set up for the whole test class (either through a call to
 * {@link mockit.Mockit#setUpMocks} from inside a {@code @BeforeClass} method, or by annotating the test class with
 * {@link mockit.UsingMocksAndStubs}) will only apply to the test methods in this same test class.
 * That is, you should not explicitly tell JMockit to restore the mocked classes in an {@code @AfterClass} method.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * Test methods will accept <em>mock parameters</em>, whose values are mocked instances automatically created by JMockit
 * and passed by the test runner when the test method gets executed. 
 * </li>
 * </ol>
