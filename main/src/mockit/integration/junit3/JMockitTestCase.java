/**
 * Simply makes sure that JMockit is initialized before the first JUnit 3.8 test runs.
 * <p/>
 * If using the JVM parameter "-javaagent:jmockit.jar" or using JDK 1.6+ with {@code jmockit.jar}
 * preceding {@code junit-4.n.jar} in the classpath, this class doesn't need to be used.
 * Otherwise, all JUnit 3.8 test classes will need to either extend it or verify the initialization
 * of JMockit by calling {@code Mockit.setUpMocks()} in a static initializer or constructor of the
 * test class.
