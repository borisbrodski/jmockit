/**
 * Indicates a test class, an instance field declared in a test class, or a test method parameter
 * which will capture all implementations of a given base type (usually an interface or abstract
 * class).
 * <p/>
 * When applied to a test class, each class implementing/extending the explicitly specified
 * {@linkplain #baseType base type} will be stubbed out for the whole test class.
 * <p/>
 * When applied to an instance field or test method parameter, the declared type of the field or
 * parameter will be considered a mocked type, just as it would be if annotated with
 * {@link Mocked @Mocked}.
 * Each class implementing (in case the mocked type is an interface) or extending (in case the
 * mocked type is a class) the mocked type will also be mocked.
 * <p/>
 * Examples:

    * during test execution and the specified number of new instances has not been previously
    * assigned, the (non-<code>final</code>) mock field will be assigned that new instance.
