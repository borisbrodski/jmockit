/**
 * Provides the main classes and annotations used when writing tests with the JMockit toolkit.
 * <p/>
 * The {@link mockit.Mockit} class contains a group of <code>setUpMock/setUpMocks</code> static
 * methods that can be used to set up <em>state-oriented</em> mock implementations.
 * They rely on the {@link mockit.Mock} and {@link mockit.MockClass} annotations.
 * <p/>
 * The {@link mockit.MockUp} class is a convenient wrapper for common uses of the
 * {@link mockit.Mockit#setUpMock(Class, Object)} and {@link mockit.Mockit#setUpMock(Object)}
 * methods, which allows the definition of in-line mocks for individual tests.
 * <p/>
 * The {@link mockit.Expectations} class provides an API for the traditional <em>record-replay</em>
 * model of recording expected invocations which are later replayed and automatically verified.
 * This API makes use of the {@link mockit.Mocked} annotation.
 * <p/>
 * The {@link mockit.Verifications} class, when combined with the use of the
 * {@link mockit.NonStrictExpectations} class, the {@link mockit.NonStrict} annotation and/or the
 * {@link mockit.Expectations#notStrict()} method, extends the record-replay model to a
 * <em>record-replay-verify</em> model, where the record phase can be empty (or not) and the
 * verifications can be done explicitly.
