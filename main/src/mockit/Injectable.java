package mockit;

import java.lang.annotation.*;

/**
 * Indicates an instance field of the test class or a parameter of the test method whose value will be an <em>injectable
 * mocked instance</em>.
 * Such instances can be said to be proper <em>mock objects</em>, in contrast to the <em>mocked instances</em> of a
 * regular mocked type.
 * The intent is that these mock objects will be passed/injected into the tested object/unit.
 * <p/>
 * The use of this annotation implies that the declared type of the mock field/parameter is a mocked type, just like it
 * would be if annotated with {@linkplain Mocked @Mocked}.
 * The {@code @Mocked} annotation can be applied at the same, if needed.
 * The default mocking behavior, however, is different in several ways.
 * <p/>
 * Mock fields or parameters with injectable instances can be of any reference type.
 * Note that, while allowed, the use of this annotation is redundant for interfaces or annotations, since their
 * instances always belong to a mock class which cannot possibly have regular (non-mock) instances.
 * It is also redundant for an enum type, since each enum value is unique.
 * For the duration of each test where the mock field/parameter is in scope, <em>only one</em> injectable instance is
 * mocked; other instances of the same mocked type are not affected.
 * For such a mocked type with mocking restricted to a single instance, <em>static methods</em> and
 * <em>constructors</em> belonging to a mocked class are <em>not</em> mocked; only instance methods are.
 * Static initializers of said classes are <em>not</em> stubbed out by default.
 * <p/>
 * For each mocked type there is at least one <em>target class for mocking</em>, which is derived from the declared type
 * of the mock field or parameter.
 * By default, all instance methods (including those which are {@code final}, {@code private}, {@code abstract}, or
 * {@code native}) in the target classes will be mocked. Mock behavior, however, will only apply to the particular
 * instance of the mock field/parameter which was created by JMockit or (in the case of {@code final} mock fields) by
 * user code.
 * <p/>
 * The following rules are applied when deriving the target classes from a declared mocked class type:
 * <ol>
 * <li>The type is a concrete class: this class and all its super-classes up to but excluding
 * {@code java.lang.Object} will be the target classes for mocking.</li>
 * <li>The type is an <em>abstract class</em>: a concrete subclass is generated with mock implementations for the
 * abstract methods in that class and in all of its super-classes (again, excluding {@code Object}); these super-classes
 * are targeted for mocking of the non-abstract methods.</li>
 * </ol>
