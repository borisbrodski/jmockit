/**
 * Indicates a {@linkplain Mocked mocked type} where the return types of non-{@code void} methods,
 * excluding primitives, {@code String}, and collection types, will be automatically mocked if and
 * when a invocation to the method occurs.
 * Instead of returning the default {@literal null} reference, such methods will return a mock
 * instance on which further invocations can be made.
 * This behavior automatically cascades to those mocked return types.
