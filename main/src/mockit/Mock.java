/**
 * Used inside a <em>mock class</em> to indicate a <em>mock method</em> or <em>mock
 * constructor</em>, with optional <em>expectations</em> on the number of invocations while the mock
 * is in effect.
 * (A mock will be in effect from the time a real method/constructor is mocked to the time it is
 * restored to its original definition.)
 * <p/>
 * This annotation can also be applied to the special methods <strong><code>void
 * $init(...)</code></strong> and <strong><code>void $clinit()</code></strong>, which correspond to
 * constructors and to class initializers, respectively.
 * <p/>
 * In the latter case, this is the only way to mock a static <em>class initialization block</em>.
 * Notice that it makes no difference if the real class contains more than one static initialization
 * block, because the Java compiler will always merge the sequence of static blocks into a single
 * internal "&lt;clinit>" static method in the class file.
 * <p/>
 * Mock methods named <code>$init</code> will apply to the corresponding constructor (by taking into
 * consideration the parameters) in the real class. The advantages of mocking a constructor this way
 * instead of using an actual mock constructor are three: 1) the <code>it</code> field can be used
 * in the <code>$init</code> method, while in a mock constructor such field would not be set before
 * the mock constructor was called; 2) the <code>$init</code> method will be called on the mock
 * instance if one is provided by the test, contrary to a mock constructor which is always called on
 * a new mock instance; and 3) the <code>$init</code> method can be static, which a constructor
 * cannot.
 * <p/>
 * Finally, a note about <em>instance initialization blocks</em>. The Java compiler does not
 * preserve instance initializers as separate elements in the class file, instead inserting any
 * statements in such blocks into each and every constructor, right after the necessary call to the
 * superclass constructor. Therefore, it is not possible to separately mock instance initialization
 * blocks.
