/**
 * Used inside a <em>mock class</em> to indicate a <em>mock method</em>, with optional <em>expectations</em> on the
 * number of invocations while the mock is in effect.
 * (A mock will be in effect from the time a real method/constructor is mocked to the time it is restored to its
 * original definition.)
 * <p/>
 * This annotation can also be applied to the special methods <strong>{@code void $init(...)}</strong> and
 * <strong>{@code void $clinit()}</strong>, which correspond to constructors and to class initializers, respectively.
 * In the latter case, this is the only way to mock a static <em>class initialization block</em>.
 * (Notice that it makes no difference if the real class contains more than one static initialization block, because the
 * Java compiler will always merge the sequence of static blocks into a single internal "&lt;clinit>" static method in
 * the class file.)
 * Mock methods named {@code $init} will apply to the corresponding constructor in the real class, by matching the
 * declared parameters.
 * <p/>
 * Finally, a note about <em>instance initialization blocks</em>. The Java compiler does not preserve instance
 * initializers as separate elements in the class file, instead inserting any statements in such blocks into each and
 * every constructor, right after the necessary call to the super-class constructor.
 * Therefore, it is not possible to separately mock instance initialization blocks.
