   For a quick introduction to JMockit go to this page:
   <a href="http://jmockit.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/www/gettingStarted.html"
      target="gettingStarted">Getting started</a>.
   For the motivations that led to the creation of the toolkit and a brief introduction (with
   examples) to the main APIs, check out the
   <a href="http://jmockit.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/www/about.html" target="homepage">About JMockit</a>
   page.
</p>
<p>
   The <a href="http://jmockit.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/www/tutorial.html" target="tutorial">tutorial</a>
   contains an extensive and user-friendly description of all the available tools and APIs, with
   plenty of example code.
</p>
<p>
   The full distribution (in a zip file) contains several
   <a href="http://jmockit.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/www/samples.html" target="samples">sample test
      suites</a> written with the toolkit APIs.
   There are individual test suites for comparison with other popular mocking toolkits, providing
   the JMockit versions of the official example tests found on the Web for each other toolkit.
