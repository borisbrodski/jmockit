<h2>State-based testing with JMockit</h2>

<p>
   In the JMockit toolkit, the <code>Annotations</code> API provides support for the creation of
   <em>state-based</em> tests.
   The focus when doing this kind of testing is not on the <em>interactions</em> between objects,
   but on their <em>state</em> after the code under test is exercised, and on the data items
   exchanged between objects.
</p>
<p>
   State verification <em>after</em> the unit under test is exercised can be done through regular
   JUnit/TestNG assertions.
   The JMockit Annotations API allows a test to apply state verification <em>during</em> test
   execution, as the tested unit passes data to dependencies through method/constructor invocations.
