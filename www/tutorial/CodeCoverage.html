<p>
   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_coverage"><em>Code coverage</em></a> consists of a set of software metrics
   that can tell you how much of the production code is covered by a given test suite.
   It's purely quantitative, and does not say anything about the <em>quality</em> of either the production code or the
   test code.
   That said, the examination of code coverage reports will sometimes lead to the discovery of unreachable code which
   can be eliminated.
   But more importantly, such reports can be used as a guide for the discovery of missing tests.
   This is not only useful when creating tests for existing production code, but also when writing tests first, such as
   in the practice of TDD (Test Driven Development).
</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">

<p>
   JMockit Coverage provides two different and complementary code coverage metrics:
   <em>line coverage</em> and <em>path coverage</em>.
   An example coverage report showing both metrics can be found <a href="../coverage-sample/index.html">here</a>.
</p>

<h3 id="line">
   Line Coverage
   <div class="navigation">
      <a href="../tutorial.html"><img align="right" src="go-home.png" title="Contents"></a>
      <img align="right" src="blank.gif" width="22">

   </div>
</h3>
<p>
   The <em>line coverage</em> metric tells us how much of the <em>executable code</em> in a source
   file has been exercised by tests.
   Each executable line of code can be <em>uncovered</em>, <em>covered</em>, or
   <em>partially covered</em>.
   In the first case, <em>none</em> of the executable code in it was executed at all.
   In the second, <em>all</em> of the code was fully executed at least once.
   In the third case, only <em>part</em> of the executable code in the line was executed.
   This can happen, for example, with lines of code containing multiple logical conditions in a
   complex boolean expression.
   JMockit Coverage identifies all three cases, computing the <em>coverage percentage</em> for each
   executable line of code accordingly: <strong>0%</strong> for an uncovered line,
   <strong>100%</strong> for a covered line, or some value in between for a partially covered line.
</p>
<p>
   A <em>branching point</em> exists wherever the program makes a decision between two possible
   execution paths to follow.
   Any line of code containing a logical condition will be divided in at least two executable
   <em>segments</em>, each belonging to a separate <em>branch</em>.
   An executable line of source code with no branching points contains a single segment.
   Lines with one or more branching points contain two or more executable segments, separated by
   consecutive branching points in the line.
</p>
<p>
   Lets say that <code><strong>NS</strong> >= 1</code> is the number of executable segments on a given line.
   If <code><strong>NE</strong></code> is the number of segments in that line which were executed at
   least once during a test run (ie, they are <em>covered segments</em>), then we can calculate the
   coverage percentage for the line as <strong><code>100 * NE / NS</code></strong>.
</p>
<p>
   Similarly, the line coverage percentage for a whole source file is calculated from the total number of executable
   segments and the total number of covered segments, considering all executable lines of code in the file.
   The percentage for a <em>package</em>, in turn, is calculated from the total and covered numbers of segments in the
   whole set of source files belonging to the package.
   Finally, the <em>total code coverage</em> percentage is computed by the same formula on the totals for all packages.

   </div>
   Path Coverage
</h3>
<p>
   A completely different metric is <em>path coverage</em>, which is computed for method and
   constructor bodies, not for lines or segments of code.
   It tells us how many of the possible <em>execution paths</em> through a method or constructor,
   from <em>entry</em> to <em>exit</em>, have been executed at least once during the test run.
</p>
<p>
   Note that each method or constructor has a single point of entry, but can have multiple exits.
   An exit occurs when a <code>return</code> or <code>throw</code> statement is executed.
   These are <em>normal exits</em>, of course. A method/constructor execution can also terminate
   <em>abruptly</em>, by propagating an exception (or error) thrown as a result of a method call,
   an attempt to access a <code>null</code> reference, or some other action which caused an
   unintended program failure.
</p>
<p>
   Each possible path can be either fully executed (covered) or not (uncovered).
   Paths that execute only partially (ie, they were terminated abruptly) are simply considered as
   uncovered.
</p>
<p>
   The <em>path coverage percentage</em> for a method or constructor body is computed in a way
   similar to the line coverage computation.
   If <code><strong>NP</strong></code> is the number of possible paths through the implementation
   body and <code><strong>NPE</strong></code> is the number of paths executed from entry to exit,
   then the metric is computed as <strong><code>100 * NPE / NP</code></strong>.
   Also in the same way as the line coverage metric, we extend this formula to the whole source
   file, the whole package, and the whole set of packages touched by the test run.
</p>

   Available types of coverage output

</h3>
<p>
   The JMockit Coverage tool can generate the following types of output:
</p>
<ol>
   <li>
      <strong>XHTML reports</strong>: a multi-page XHTML report is written in the "coverage-report"
      directory, under the current working directory (a different output directory can be specified
      if needed).
      The directory is created if it doesn't yet exist; its contents are overwritten if previously
      generated.
      The report will include pages containing all Java source files covered by the test suite.
      By default, the tool looks for ".java" source files inside all directories of name "src" found
      directly or indirectly under the current working directory; any intermediate sub-directories
      between "src" and the top-level package directory, such as "src/java" for example, are also
      searched.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Coverage data files</strong>: a single serialized file of name "coverage.ser" is
      written under the current working directory or under an specified output directory.
      If the file already exists its contents are first read and <em>merged</em> with the in-memory
      results of the current test run.
      In the end, the file is overwritten with the merged coverage data.
   </li>
</ol>

<h4 id="callPoints">Call points</h4>
<p>
   When running a test suite with the coverage tool, there is optional "call point" information
   which can be gathered, as selected by the user.
   A <em>call point</em> is the point in the source test code from which an specific line of
   production code was exercised.
   Note that generating coverage with this extra information takes more time and produces
   significantly larger output. On the other hand, it can be useful to know which lines of test code
   caused a given line of production code to be executed during the test run.
   The XHTML report makes this information easily viewable, though hiding it at first.

</h3>
<p>
   First of all, to enable the JMockit Coverage tool at least one of several <em>coverage jars</em>
   needs to be added to the classpath.
   The main jar file, which contains all of the tool implementation code, is
   <code>jmockit-coverage.jar</code>.
   Adding any of the other <code>jmockit-coverage-xyz.jar</code> files to the classpath will result
   in having this one added implicitly (provided all jars are available in the same installation
   directory).
</p>
<p>
   Whatever the coverage jar(s) used, <code>jmockit.jar</code> (or a versioned jar obtained from the
   <a href="http://jmockit.googlecode.com/svn/maven-repo/">Maven repository</a>) does <em>not</em> need to be added to
   the classpath, unless of course the suite contains tests which use the JMockit mocking APIs (it will also be
   implicitly added to the classpath).
   That said, it <em>may</em> be necessary to use the <code>-javaagent:jmockit.jar</code> JVM parameter
   so that JMockit gets properly initialized at start-up. It is possible to avoid the use of this JVM
   parameter, depending on a few conditions. See <a href="RunningTests.html">this page</a> for details.
</p>
<p>
   Apart from enabling JMockit Coverage for a given test run, there are five aspects of the tool's
   behavior which can optionally be configured for the test run:
</p>
<ol>
   <li>
      The <strong>output format</strong> desired: an XHTML report or a data file for merging of
      multiple test runs. Both kinds of output can be selected for the same test run.
      The default if none is specified is to generate a basic XHTML report.
   </li>
   <li>
      The <strong>output directory</strong> where output files should be written.
      By default, the current working directory of the running JVM is used, with all ".html" files
      of the XHTML report generated inside a "coverage-report" sub-directory. Sub-directories are
      automatically created as needed.
   </li>
   <li>
      The list of <strong>source directories</strong> for the XHTML report.
      (This is not relevant for the serialized data file.)
      If no such directory is specified, all "src" directories under the current working directory
      will be considered.
   </li>
   <li>
      The set of Java classes which should be considered for coverage gathering.
      By default, all classes in production code loaded during the test run and which are not inside
      jar files will be considered.
   </li>
   <li>
      The specific set of code coverage <strong>metrics</strong> which should be considered.
      By default, all available metrics (<em>line</em>, <em>path</em>, and <em>data</em> coverage)
      are included.
   </li>
</ol>

<h4 id="classpathConfiguration">Selecting the desired output through classpath configuration</h4>
<p>
   To select the desired output format(s) to be generated for a test run, add one or more of the
   following jar files to the classpath:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>
      <code>jmockit-coverage-<strong>htmlbasic</strong>.jar</code>:
      generates an XHTML report <em>without</em> call points.
   </li>
   <li>
      <code>jmockit-coverage-<strong>htmlfull</strong>.jar</code>:
      generates an XHTML report <em>with</em> call points.
   </li>
   <li>
      <code>jmockit-coverage-<strong>serial</strong>.jar</code>:
      generates a <em>serialized data file</em> of name "coverage.ser".
   </li>
   <li>
      <code>jmockit-coverage-<strong>merge</strong>.jar</code>:
      generates the same serialized data file, but after <em>merging</em> the coverage data gathered
      by the current test run with an existing "coverage.ser" file (if any is found in the working
      dir - otherwise has the same effect as <code>jmockit-coverage-serial.jar</code>).
   </li>
</ul>
<p>
   The "htmlbasic" and "htmlfull" jars are mutually exclusive, just like "serial" and "merge" are.
   However, it <em>is</em> valid to have one of each pair in the classpath at the same time.
   In such a case, at the end of the test run both a "coverage.ser" file and a "coverage-report" 
   directory (unless another is specified) will be written.
</p>
<p>
   Each one of these <em>output specification jars</em> is empty except for the standard
   <code>META-INF/MANIFEST.MF</code> file.
   Still, they depend on <strong><code>jmockit-coverage.jar</code></strong> and this is specified
   through the <code>Class-Path</code> property inside <code>MANIFEST.MF</code>.
   Consequently, if this last jar file is available in the same directory then it does not need to
   be explicitly added to the classpath; otherwise, it (or an equivalent jar from the Maven
   repository) will need to be added.
</p>
<p>
   If none of the output specification jars is added to the classpath, but
   <code>jmockit-coverage.jar</code> is, then the "htmlbasic" report will be generated.
</p>

<h4 id="propertyConfiguration">Configuration through system properties</h4>
<p>
   To have control over all aspects of the code coverage tool, set one or more
   <em>system properties</em> for the JVM instance that will run the test suite.
   Note that you should be able to do this inside an Ant target, a Maven <code>surefire</code>
   plugin configuration, or a test run configuration for your Java IDE of choice, using either
   JUnit or TestNG.
</p>
<p>
   The available system properties, all prefixed with "jmockit-coverage-", are:
</p>
<ol>
   <li>
      <code>jmockit-coverage-<strong>output</strong></code>: one or more comma-separated values
      between <strong><code>html</code></strong>, <strong><code>html-nocp</code></strong>,
      <strong><code>serial</code></strong>, and <strong><code>merge</code></strong>.
      The "nocp" suffix stands for "no call points".
      The use of this system property takes precedence over the presence of coverage jars in the
      classpath.
   </li>
   <li>
      <code>jmockit-coverage-<strong>outputDir</strong></code>: absolute or relative path to the
      output directory, to be used for writing any "coverage.ser" or "index.html" files (plus the
      remaining ".html" files of the XHTML report, in automatically created sub-directories).
   </li>
   <li>
      <code>jmockit-coverage-<strong>srcDirs</strong></code>: comma-separated list of Java source 
      directories to be searched when generating an XHTML report.
      Each directory is specified by an absolute or relative path.
   </li>
   <li>
      <code>jmockit-coverage-<strong>classes</strong></code>:
      a <code>java.util.regex</code>-conformable regular expression which will be used to select
      the classes from production code which are considered for coverage.
   </li>
   <li>
      <code>jmockit-coverage-<strong>excludes</strong></code>:
      a <code>java.util.regex</code>-conformable regular expression for class names which should be
      excluded from consideration when deciding which classes will be modified to gather coverage.
      This property can be used together with <code>jmockit-coverage-classes</code> or on its own.
   </li>
   <li>
      <code>jmockit-coverage-<strong>metrics</strong></code>:
      one or more comma-separated words between <strong><code>line</code></strong>,
      <strong><code>path</code></strong>, <strong><code>data</code></strong>, and
      <strong><code>all</code></strong> (the default).
   </li>
</ol>
<p>
   The class selection regular expressions should specify the fully qualified names of classes in
   production code for which coverage is desired.
   For example, "orderMngr\.domain\..+" selects all classes in the <code>orderMngr.domain</code>
   package as well as in any sub-packages.

   </div>
</h3>
<p>
   Suppose you have multiple test run configurations (in separate Ant targets, for example), and
   you want to generate a single XHTML report for the code covered by the full set of tests.
   Normally, when JMockit Coverage generates a report at the end of a test run, it overwrites any
   previous report that may have been generated in the same output directory.
   So, instead of getting a merged report as desired, you would end up with the report for the last
   test run only (assuming all test runs used the same working dir).
   Here is where the serialized data files ("coverage.ser" files generated in the same or in
   different output directories) come in.
</p>
<p>
   As seen in other sections, we activate the generation of this file by either adding
   <code>jmockit-coverage-serial.jar</code> or <code>jmockit-coverage-merge.jar</code> to the
   classpath, or by setting the <code>jmockit-coverage-output</code> system property.
</p>
<p>
   There are different ways to use the merging of multiple coverage data files. The following
   sub-sections provide the details for each use case.
</p>

<h4 id="singleMergedReport">Generating a single aggregate report for multiple test runs</h4>
<p>
   Lets say you have multiple test run configurations (for example, multiple <code>junit</code> or
   <code>testng</code> tasks in the same Ant target) to be executed at once, and want to produce a
   single aggregate coverage report for the full set of tests. That is, you don't want to produce a
   separate report for each individual test run.
   The easiest way to achieve this is to use the same working directory for all test runs, with
   <code>jmockit-coverage-merge.jar</code> in the classpath or with
   <code>jmockit-coverage-output=merge</code> specified as a system property for each test run
   configuration. Since the XHTML report is only desired at the end, the last test run configuration
   in the sequence should either have the appropriate coverage jar in the classpath or add the
   appropriate value to the <code>jmockit-coverage-output</code> property.
   The "coverage.ser" file will be shared between all test runs. The first test run must
   <em>not</em> read data from this file, therefore it should either be deleted or ignored by the
   first test run by using <code>jmockit-coverage-serial.jar</code> or
   <code>jmockit-coverage-output=serial</code> instead.
</p>

<h4 id="separateAggregateReport">Generating an aggregate report from a set of data files</h4>
<p>
   Suppose you want to generate a separate coverage report for <em>each</em> test run configuration
   and also an aggregate report merging together the results from all test runs.
   In this case we would have <code>n</code> test runs but <code>n + 1</code> coverage reports.
   Only one XHTML report can be produced from a single test run, so an extra step which doesn't
   execute any tests is necessary.
   In order to preserve the original <code>coverage.ser</code> output files generated by each test
   run, they will need to be written or copied into different output directories.
</p>
<p>
   Assuming that two or more <code>coverage.ser</code> files are available in separate directories,
   an aggregate report can be generated from them by executing the
   <code>mockit.coverage.CodeCoverage.main</code> method (a regular Java "main" method).
   To facilitate this, the <code>jmockit-coverage-htmlbasic.jar</code> and
   <code>jmockit-coverage-htmlfull.jar</code> files are <em>executable</em>.
   Using Ant, the following task could be used:
</p>
<pre><code>   &lt;java
      fork="yes" dir="myBaseDir" jar="jmockit-coverage-htmlfull.jar"
      args="module1-outDir,anotherOutDir"/>
</code></pre>
<p>
   The example above uses "myBaseDir" as the base directory where a separate JVM instance will run.
   Two output directories containing "coverage.ser" data files are specified, separated by commas,
   as the first command line argument.
   Other configuration parameters can be specified through the "jmockit-coverage-xyz" system properties.
   This separate JVM instance will read each of the "coverage.ser" data files, merge the coverage
   data in memory, and then generate the aggregate XHTML report before exiting.
</p>

</h3>
<p>
   If you run tests with the "test" Maven goal, then you will need the following dependency in <code>pom.xml</code>:
</p>
<pre><code>      &lt;dependency>
         &lt;groupId>mockit&lt;/groupId>
         &lt;artifactId>jmockit-coverage&lt;/artifactId>
         &lt;version>0.999.5&lt;/version>
         &lt;scope>runtime&lt;/scope> 
      &lt;/dependency>
</code></pre>
<p>
   Notice that it will probably be useful to define a property for the JMockit version in use:
</p>
<pre><code>   &lt;properties>
      &lt;jmockit.version>0.999.9&lt;/jmockit.version>
   &lt;/properties>
</code></pre>
<p>
   In Maven 2, the <code>surefire</code> plugin is the one usually responsible for actually running tests.
   To configure the coverage tool, specify values for the appropriate "jmockit-coverage-xyz" system
   properties. For example, the output directory for generated files can be specified through the
   <code>jmockit-coverage-outputDir</code> property.
</p>
<pre class="no-highlight"><code>&lt;plugin>
   &lt;groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins&lt;/groupId>
   &lt;artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin&lt;/artifactId>
   &lt;configuration>
      <span class="comment">&lt;!-- uncomment this if needed
      &lt;argLine>
         -javaagent:"${settings.localRepository}"/mockit/jmockit/${jmockit.version}/jmockit-${jmockit.version}.jar
      &lt;/argLine>
      --></span>
      &lt;systemProperties>
         &lt;property>
            &lt;name>jmockit-coverage-outputDir&lt;/name>&lt;value>target/my-coverage-report&lt;/value>
         &lt;/property>
         <span class="comment">&lt;!-- other "jmockit-coverage" properties... --></span>
      &lt;/systemProperties>
   &lt;/configuration>
&lt;/plugin>
</code></pre>
<p>
   If the tests are run in a Java SE 5 JVM, or if for whatever reason JMockit cannot be
   automatically initialized when running on Java SE 6 (typically, when using the IBM or Apple
   JDKs), then the <code>-javaagent</code> JVM parameter should be used as shown above.
</p>

</h3>
<p>
   To facilitate switching on/off the generation of code coverage output, the
   <em>read-only status</em> of the relevant file is checked by JMockit at startup.
   The relevant file, always in the working directory, is "coverage.ser" for serialized output and
   "coverage-report/index.html" for XHTML output. (Note that the working directory can usually be
   selected separately for each test run configuration in the Java IDE.)
   If said file is currently marked as read-only in the OS, then the corresponding output is not

   Notice that a Java IDE usually provides an easy mechanism to toggle the read-only status of a
   project file. In IntelliJ IDEA it is done by double clicking the status bar, with the desired
   file opened in the editor. In Eclipse there is a "Read only" check box in the "Properties" screen
   for the text file selected in the editor; this screen can be opened by typing "Alt + Enter".

<p>
   Another way to switch coverage on/off is to use the <strong><code>jmockit-tools</code></strong>
   system property, which can specify the "startup tools", between those available in the classpath
   (if any), to be loaded by JMockit at startup.
   For the coverage tool, the word <strong>"coverage"</strong> must be present in the value
   specified for the property (which can contain two or more tool names separated by commas).
