<h2>Capturing implementation classes and instances on demand</h2>

<p>
   In the chapter on <a href="BehaviorBasedTesting.html#capturing">behavior-based testing</a> we saw
   how to "capture" instances of interfaces or base classes through a
   <code>@Mocked(capture = &lt;n>)</code> annotation, applied to mock fields or parameters.
   Now we are going to see a more general mechanism to capture implementations and instances, which
   can also be used in tests that don't rely on the Expectations API.
</p>
<div style="text-align: center;" title="Click for API documentation">
   <map name="figure1">
      <area shape="rect" coords="8,9,111,37" href="../javadoc/mockit/Capturing.html">
   </map>
   <img src="Capturing.png" usemap="#figure1">
</div>
<p>
   The <code>mockit.Capturing</code> annotation can be applied to test classes, to mock instance
   fields, and to mock test method parameters.
   In the first case, it does not matter if individual tests are pure JUnit/TestNG tests, or if they
   are written with any of the available mocking APIs.
   In the other cases (mock fields/parameters), this annotation will be used in conjunction with
   the Expectations API.
