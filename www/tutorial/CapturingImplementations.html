<p>
   In the chapter on <a href="BehaviorBasedTesting.html#capturing">behavior-based testing</a> we saw
   how to "capture" instances of interfaces or base classes through a
   <code><span class="annotation">@Mocked</span>(capture = &lt;n>)</code> annotation, applied to mock fields or
   parameters.
   Now we are going to see a more general mechanism to capture implementations and instances, which
   can also be used in tests that don't rely on the Expectations API.
</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
   <map name="figure1">
      <area shape="rect" coords="1,1,113,34" href="../javadoc/mockit/Capturing.html">
   </map>

</div>
<p>
   The <code class="type">mockit.Capturing</code> annotation can be applied to test classes, to mock instance fields,
   and to mock test method parameters.
   In the first case, it does not matter if individual tests are pure JUnit/TestNG tests, or if they are written with
   any of the available mocking APIs.
   In the other cases (mock fields/parameters), this annotation is used in conjunction with the Expectations &
   Verifications API.
</p>

<h3 id="stubbing">Stubbing out implementation classes for a whole test class</h3>
<p>
   If you have several tests which happen to load classes that implement abstractions (Java interfaces or base classes),
   but those classes are not known at compile time (or you simply don't want test code to have compile-time dependencies
   on them), then it may be necessary to stub them out to avoid interference with other parts of the tested code.
   The following test class, where <code class="type">MyService</code> is an arbitrary interface or base class
   (<code>abstract</code> or not), provides an example.
</p>
<pre><code><strong>@Capturing(baseType = MyService.class)</strong>
public final class CapturingImplementationsTest
{
   @Test
   public void aTestMethod()
   {
      ...

      // In the tested production code, a suitable implementation class is selected
      // through external configuration, loaded, and instantiated:
      MyService service = ...

      ...
   
      // Another implementation class may be created deep inside production code, as
      // an anonymous inner class (which will also get stubbed out):
      MyService another = new MyService()
      {
         ...
      };
      ...
   }

   ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>
   For all tests defined in the annotated test class, all implementations of the specified base type
   will get fully stubbed out, independently of how or when the concrete implementation classes
   actually get loaded by the JVM. Implementation classes loaded by previously executed tests in
   another test class will also be stubbed out. All class definitions will get automatically
   restored for the next test class in the same test run, though.
</p>
<p>
   The <code>baseType</code> attribute is only used in this situation, where the annotation is
   applied to a test class. In other situations it normally isn't used, since the base type can be
   inferred from the declared type of an annotated field or parameter.
</p>

<h4 id="filtering">Filtering implementation classes by name</h4>
<p>
   It's possible to filter the classes to be stubbed out by specifying one or more
   <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html">regular expressions</a> through
   the <strong><code>classNames</code></strong> attribute.
   Each regular expression must match the fully qualified names of the desired classes.
   The set of filters can be inverted through the <strong><code>inverse</code></strong> attribute, so that only the
   classes <em>not</em> matching the specified regular expressions will get stubbed out.
</p>

<h3 id="mocking">Mocking unknown implementation classes</h3>
<p>
   If some tests need to verify the interaction between tested code and the captured base types,
   then <em>mocking</em> rather than mere <em>stubbing</em> is required.
   Such tests can use the <code class="annotation">@Capturing</code> annotation just like they would use the
   <code class="annotation">@Mocked</code> annotation, in the declaration of a mock field or test method parameter.
   The <code>baseType</code> attribute can be used to specify the mocked type, but this is only
   necessary if said type differs from the declared type of the mock field/parameter.
</p>
<p>
   Filtering of implementation classes can be done just like in the case where the annotation is
   applied to the test class.
</p>
<p>
   The semantics for mock fields and parameters annotated with <code class="annotation">@Capturing</code> are the same
   as if they were annotated with <code><span class="annotation">@Mocked</span>(capture = n)</code>, with
   <code>n > 0</code>.
   The <strong><code>maxInstances</code></strong> attribute can be used to specify the maximum
   number of instances to capture, when the annotation is applied to a non-<code>final</code> mock
   field (by default, all instances are captured for any "<code>@Capturing</code>" field/parameter).
