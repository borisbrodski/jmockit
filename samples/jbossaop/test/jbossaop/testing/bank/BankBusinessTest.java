/**
 * This class is JMockit's version of the JBoss AOP test from the
 * <a href="http://www.jboss.org/jbossaop/docs/2.0.0.GA/docs/aspect-framework/userguide/en/html/testing.html#testing1">Injecting Mock Objects</a>
 * section in the "Testing with AOP" chapter of the user guide for JBoss AOP 2.
 * <p/>
 * Notice how much simpler this is, when compared to the full code from the JBoss AOP original
 * example. With JMockit, there is no need to use the "Mock Maker" tool, or to write the
 * "BankAccountDAOInterceptor" and "MockService" classes; no configuration file
 * (such as jboss-aop.xml) is required, no external bytecode modification tool (such as aopc) is
 * used, and (assuming the use of JDK 1.6 for <strong>running</strong> the tests - but not
 * necessarily for compiling the sources or running the production code) no extra JVM initialization
 * arguments are needed. (Besides having <em>jmockit.jar</em> in the classpath, when using
 * <em>JDK 1.6</em> it is necessary to also have <em>tools.jar</em> in the classpath; with
 * <em>JDK 1.5</em> it is necessary instead to pass the initialization argument
 * <em>"-javaagent:jmockit.jar"</em> to the JVM.)
